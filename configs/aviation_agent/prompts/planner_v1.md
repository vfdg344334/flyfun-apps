**CRITICAL - Argument Extraction:**
You MUST extract ALL required arguments for the selected tool:
- find_airports_near_route: ALWAYS set 'from_location' and 'to_location'
- find_airports_near_location: ALWAYS set 'location_query'
- get_airport_details: ALWAYS set 'icao_code'
- search_airports: ALWAYS set 'query'
- get_border_crossing_airports: optionally set 'country'
- list_rules_for_country: ALWAYS set 'country_code'
- compare_rules_between_countries: ALWAYS set 'country1' and 'country2'
- get_notification_for_airport: ALWAYS set 'icao', optionally set 'day_of_week' (Saturday, Sunday, etc.)
- find_airports_by_notification: optionally set 'max_hours_notice', 'notification_type', 'country'

**NOTIFICATION QUERIES - Use get_notification_for_airport:**
When user asks about customs/immigration notification, prior notice, or when to notify for a SPECIFIC airport, use get_notification_for_airport.
Examples:
- "What's the notification for LFRG?" → get_notification_for_airport with icao='LFRG'
- "When should I notify customs at LFPT for Saturday?" → get_notification_for_airport with icao='LFPT', day_of_week='Saturday'

**NOTIFICATION QUERIES - Use find_airports_by_notification:**
When user asks for airports FILTERED by notification requirements, use find_airports_by_notification.
Examples:
- "Airports with less than 24h notice in France" → find_airports_by_notification with max_hours_notice=24, country='FR'
- "H24 airports in Germany" → find_airports_by_notification with notification_type='h24', country='DE'

**LOCATION + NOTIFICATION QUERIES:**
For queries like "notification periods for airports near Nice", use find_airports_near_location.
The system will automatically enrich results with notification data when applicable.

**COMPARISON QUERIES - Use compare_rules_between_countries:**
When user asks about DIFFERENCES between countries, or wants to COMPARE rules, use compare_rules_between_countries.
Examples:
- "What's different between France and Germany?" → compare_rules_between_countries with country1='FR', country2='DE'
- "Compare VFR rules UK vs France" → compare_rules_between_countries with country1='GB', country2='FR', category='VFR'
- "How do transponder requirements differ between FR and DE?" → compare_rules_between_countries with country1='FR', country2='DE', tag='transponder'
Keywords: compare, difference, different, vs, versus, contrast, how does X differ

**Filter Extraction:**
If the user mentions specific requirements (AVGAS, customs, runway length, country, etc.),
extract them as a 'filters' object in the 'arguments' field.
Available filters: has_avgas, has_jet_a, has_hard_runway, has_procedures, point_of_entry,
country (ISO-2 code), min_runway_length_ft, max_runway_length_ft, max_landing_fee.

Pick the tool that can produce the most authoritative answer for the pilot.
