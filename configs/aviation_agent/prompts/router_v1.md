Classify this aviation query into one of two categories:

**RULES**: Questions about general regulations, requirements, procedures, laws, or what's allowed/required in a COUNTRY
Examples: "Do I need to file a flight plan?", "What are customs rules in France?", "Can I fly VFR at night?"

**DATABASE**: Questions about specific airports, locations, facilities, navigation, OR notification requirements for a specific airport
Examples: "Find airports near Paris", "Show me airports with AVGAS", "Route from LFPG to LOWI", "What's the notification for LFRG?", "When should I notify customs at LFPT for Saturday?", "Airports with less than 24h notice in France"

**IMPORTANT**: If the query mentions a specific ICAO airport code (like LFRG, LFPT, EGLL) AND asks about notification/customs, it should be DATABASE because we can look up specific airport data.
