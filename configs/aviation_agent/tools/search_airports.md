Search for airports by ICAO code, IATA code, airport name, or city name with optional filters (country, procedures, runway, fuel, fees).

**USE THIS TOOL for direct name/code searches**, not for proximity searches.

Examples:
- "LFPG" → use this tool (ICAO code search)
- "Charles de Gaulle" → use this tool (airport name search)
- "Paris airports" → use this tool (searches airports with "Paris" in name/city)
- "CDG" → use this tool (IATA code search)

**DO NOT use this tool for "near" queries** - use find_airports_near_location instead for proximity searches.

Returns matching airports sorted by priority.
