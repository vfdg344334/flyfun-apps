# Euro AIP Airport Explorer (Web)

FastAPI + vanilla JavaScript application for browsing the FlyFun Euro AIP dataset. It exposes REST endpoints for airports, procedures, statistics, and an LLM helper API, and ships with a Leaflet/Bootstrap frontend that visualizes the data on an interactive map.

## Features

- Interactive map with procedure/border-crossing overlays and responsive layouts.
- Rich filtering across country, procedure type, approach type, runway characteristics, and standardized AIP fields.
- Detailed airport panels with procedures, runways, AIP entries, and provenance information.
- Statistics dashboard summarizing airport coverage, procedures, and data quality metrics.
- Optional chat endpoint (`/chat/ask`) that powers the MCP integration.
- Hardened backend configuration: rate limiting, security headers, CORS/trusted hosts, and optional HTTPS enforcement.

## Environment Configuration

1. Copy the provided samples:

```bash
cd web/server
cp dev.env.sample dev.env
cp security_config.py.sample security_config.py
```

2. Edit both files and provide absolute paths/secrets appropriate for your machine or deployment:

- `dev.env`
  - `AIRPORTS_DB`: absolute path to the SQLite database (e.g., `/Users/you/flyfun/data/airports.db`)
  - `RULES_JSON`: required rules metadata so the chat endpoint mirrors MCP behavior
  - `ENVIRONMENT`, `LOG_LEVEL`: runtime tuning
- `security_config.py`
  - Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`/`ALLOWED_HOSTS` for your dev/prod domains
  - Adjust `ALLOWED_DIR` if you restrict file access
  - Review rate limits, distance bounds, API key requirement, and session configuration before production

3. Load the environment in any shell session before starting the server:

```bash
source web/server/dev.env
```

> Keep per-environment files (e.g., `prod.env`) alongside the samples and ensure they stay out of version control.

## Running Locally

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd web
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the Backend

```bash
cd web
./start_server.ksh $(which python3) server/dev.env
```

`start_server.ksh` sources your env file and runs `server/main.py` with the interpreter you provide. You can also run `uvicorn server.main:app --reload` if preferred.

### Access the UI

Browse to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and the static frontend will load from the same FastAPI app. The root serves `client/index.html`, using the REST endpoints described below.

## API Overview

### Airports (`/api/airports`)

- `GET /` — list airports with query parameters for country, runway surface, procedures, border crossings, standardized fields, pagination, etc.
- `GET /{icao}` — airport detail including core metadata, runways, and procedures.
- `GET /{icao}/aip-entries` — raw and standardized AIP entries for the airport.
- `GET /{icao}/procedures`, `/runways`, `/search/{query}` — specialized lookups and search.

### Procedures (`/api/procedures`)

- Filterable list endpoints (`/`, `/approaches`, `/departures`, `/arrivals`).
- Runway-specific views (`/by-runway/{icao}`) and precision ranking (`/most-precise/{icao}`).

### Filters (`/api/filters`)

- Discover available countries, procedure types, approach types, AIP sections/fields, and fetch them all in one payload (`/all`).

### Statistics (`/api/statistics`)

- Overview counts, per-country breakdowns, procedure distribution, runway stats, and data-quality metrics.

### Chat (`/chat/ask`)

- Lightweight question/answer endpoint that leverages the shared `EuroAipModel` to assist LLM integrations (mirrors the MCP tool behavior).

All endpoints inherit the rate limiting, security headers, and host/CORS constraints defined in `security_config.py`.

## Frontend Usage

- **Search**: Type ICAO, IATA, airport name, or city; the result list collapses on selection.
- **Filters**: Toggle booleans (procedures, point of entry, etc.), select countries, procedure types, or approach types; the map and statistics update instantly.
- **Map**: Circle markers highlight airports; colors distinguish procedure coverage and border crossings. Clicking a marker syncs the details panel.
- **Charts**: Live charts update with the current filter set, powered by the statistics endpoints.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Cmd/Ctrl + F` focuses search; `Esc` resets.

## Customization & Extension

- **Security**: Harden `security_config.py` for production (API keys, HTTPS enforcement, origin restrictions, stricter limits).
- **Data**: Swap databases or rules by changing `AIRPORTS_DB` / `RULES_JSON`; the FastAPI startup reloads resources automatically.
- **Frontend**: Extend `client/js/` modules or inject additional bundles; static files are served by `StaticFiles` from `client/`.
- **New endpoints**: Add routers under `server/api/`, register them in `main.py`, and surface the data in the frontend as needed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Server fails to start**: confirm `dev.env` points to real `airports.db` / `rules.json` files (`sqlite3 your.db '.tables'`), security config imports without errors, and dependencies are installed.
- **CORS/host errors**: broaden `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`/`ALLOWED_HOSTS` while developing, then lock them down for production.
- **Blank map or empty tables**: inspect browser console, ensure the API requests return 200, and verify rate limiting is not blocking requests.
- **429 responses**: increase `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` during testing or run behind a reverse proxy with IP forwarding configured.

## Deployment Notes

- Run behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik) that terminates TLS and forwards headers; enable `FORCE_HTTPS` in production.
- Persist `dev.env`/`security_config.py` as environment-specific copies (do **not** commit real secrets or production paths).
- Monitor logs (`LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_FORMAT`) and consider externalizing settings via environment variables instead of editing the config file directly.
