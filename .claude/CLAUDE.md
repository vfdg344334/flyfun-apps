## Code Design Principles

- When adding logic around library calls, first consider whether it would be better to enhance the library itself rather than adding wrapper logic in the client code.
- Prefer pushing complexity into well-tested, reusable library code over ad-hoc client-side handling.

- always be careful to review, abstract common logic. 
- search for existing logic before duplicating and avoid code duplication
- always try to think of a few ways to implement and compare pros and cons before deciding
- always consider maintainability, testability, readability and possible future extensions

## Before implementing or planning new functionality 

  Check for existing utilities and patterns:
  1. Call `list_libraries` to discover what's available across the codebase
  2. If something relevant exists, call `get_design_doc` for implementation details
  3. For `[library]` entries: import and reuse the code
  4. For `[project]` entries: use as inspiration for patterns or architecture to follow

## Setup

- don't run npm run build as for development we use npv run dev
- use venv activate if venv exist so we use correct library
