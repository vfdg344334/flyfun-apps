    Canonical state shared between LangGraph nodes.

    LangGraph reducers merge dictionaries, so we annotate messages with
    operator.add semantics via typing_extensions.Annotated (per LangGraph docs).
    
    State supports two paths:
    1. Rules path: router → RAG retrieval → rules agent → final answer
    2. Database path: router → planner → tool → formatter → final answer
    3. Both path: router → database + rules → formatter → final answer
